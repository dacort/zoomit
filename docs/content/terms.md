If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing this site. The materials contained in this website are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.

#### 2. Use Licence

- Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on LaZ's website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a licence, not a transfer of title, and under this licence you may not:

  - attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on LaZ's website;
  - remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or
  - transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.
- This licence shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by LaZ at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this licence, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.

#### 3. Disclaimer

- The materials on LaZ's website are provided on an 'as is' basis. LaZ makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.
- Further, LaZ does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this site.

#### 4. Limitations

Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

LaZ does not warrant that any of the materials on its website are accurate, complete or current. LaZ may make changes to the materials contained on its website at any time without notice. However LaZ does not make any commitment to update the materials.

#### 6. Links

LaZ has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its website and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by LaZ of the site. Use of any such linked website is at the user's own risk.

#### 7. Modifications

LaZ may revise these terms of service for its website at any time without notice. By using this website you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these terms of service.

#### 8. Governing Law
